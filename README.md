# <ORM E-commerce Back End>

## Description

This project is the creation of a working back end database for an e-commerce site. It was created to practice my knowledge of working with sequilize, routes, and express.js. I felt like it was very helpful in utilizing the ORM to create the database more efficiently and make it easier to interact with.

## Installation

Once the repository is cloned you will simply run from your command line in the appropriate folder:
npm i
npm run seed
npm run start
Interaction is then all through insomnia as there is no front end created for this project.
